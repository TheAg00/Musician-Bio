                            <h2>Early Life</h2>
                            <p>
                                Abel Makkonen Tesfaye, known professionally as the Weeknd, was born on February 16, 1990, in Toronto, Ontario.
                                He is the only child of Ethiopian Amhara immigrants Makkonen Tesfaye and Samrawit Hailu, who separated shortly after his birth.
                                He was brought up in the district of Scarborough by his mother and grandmother. 
                                He has an estranged relationship with his father, telling Rolling Stone in 2015 that "I saw him vaguely when I was six, and then again when I was 11 or 12, and he had a new family and kids.
                                I don't even know where he lived — I'd see him for, like, a night. I'm sure he's a great guy. I never judged him. He wasn't abusive, he wasn't an alcoholic, he wasn't an asshole. He just wasn't there."
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Tesfaye was raised as an Ethiopian Orthodox. When asked whether or not he was still religious, he stated to Variety in 2020, "I dunno...everything is a test, and if you are religious or spiritual, you have to go through things."
                                His native language is Amharic, which he learned through his grandmother.He later became fluent in French by attending a French-immersion school. He was further educated at West Hill Collegiate Institute and Birchmount Park Collegiate Institute.

                                <br>
                                When he was 17, Tesfaye dropped out of school and moved to an apartment in the neighbourhood of Parkdale with two friends; including his best friend and now creative director La Mar Taylor.
                                He has described this period as being like the 1995 film Kids "without the AIDS", as they lived a hedonistic lifestyle.
                                He has also experienced homelessness and was incarcerated on several occasions during this time, which encouraged him to "smarten up, to focus."

                                <br>
                                Tesfaye often used drugs and abused illegal substances such as ketamine, cocaine, MDMA, magic mushrooms, and cough syrup.
                                In December 2016, he stated that drugs were a "crutch" for him when it came to writing music. In August 2021, during a cover story with GQ, he described himself as being "sober lite", meaning that he has stopped using drugs with the exception of marijuana.
                                He also noted that he drinks alcohol occasionally, stating: "I'm not a heavy drinker, as much as I used to be. The romance of drinking isn't there."

                                'House of Balloons'
                                Never shy about displaying his vocal talents, the Weeknd started recording his efforts while in high school.
                                After dropping out, he continued exploring his interest in music, and released a free download called House of Balloons in 2011.
                                This, along with two more mixtapes, helped push his career forward. He worked with Drake on his 2011 album, Take Care, which featured several tracks from House of Balloons, and landed a deal with Universal’s Republic Records.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                'Trilogy'
                                The Weeknd’s earlier mixtapes were re-released as 2012’s Trilogy, which became a platinum-selling record for the young artist.
                                Despite his growing popularity, he managed to hide himself from the public at large. The Weeknd refused interviews for a long time and chose to use images of women for his 2013 album, Kiss Land, rather than pictures of himself.
                                Some of the mystique he built around himself was intentional, but it also reflected the shyness and insecurities that troubled him early in his career. In addition to his own work, the Weeknd collaborated with other artists.
                                He appeared on Wiz Khalifa’s “Remember You” in 2012 and worked with Rick Ross on his 2014 album, Mastermind.
                                That same year, the Weeknd helped producer Max Martin with Ariana Grande’s hit “Love Me Harder,” and also scored success with “Earned It,” the first single released from the Fifty Shades of Grey soundtrack.

                                'Beauty Behind the Madness' and Grammy Wins
                                In 2015, the Weeknd continued his rise to the top with the No. 1 album Beauty Behind the Madness.
                                His disco-pop infused single “Can’t Feel My Face,” which could be about a romantic experience or drug use, became for many the unofficial song of the summer, while his ballad “The Hills” also made quite an impression on music fans.
                                This well-received record helped the Weeknd rack up an impressive seven nominations for the 2016 Grammy Awards, winning for Best R&B Performance for "Earned It" and Best Urban Contemporary Album.
                                He also earned an Oscar nomination for Best Original Song, also for "Earned It."

                                'Starboy'
                                In late November 2016, the Weeknd released his third album, Starboy.
                                Along with guest appearances by Lana Del Rey, Future and Kendrick Lamar, the studio effort prominently featured French electronic duo Daft Punk, who collaborated on the chart-topping title track and its follow-up single, "I Feel It Coming."
                                The following year, the Weeknd reciprocated some of the guest contributions by appearing on albums for Del Rey and Future. He then took home the Best Urban Contemporary Album Grammy for Starboy in early 2018.

                                'My Dear Melancholy'
                                In late March 2018, the Weeknd dropped My Dear Melancholy. Featuring the single "Call Out My Name," the EP marked a return to the darker, gloomier sound that permeated the artist's earlier music.
                                Shortly after the EP's release, the Weeknd headlined the two-weekend Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival, along with Beyoncé and Eminem.

                                The Weeknd returned to the spotlight in 2019 by making his feature film debut in the Adam Sandler flick "Uncut Gems."
                                Later that year he was back to making headlines with his music, dropping the singles "Heartless" — which became his fourth track to top the Billboard Hot 100 — and "Blinding Lights," ahead of the March 2020 release of the album After Hours.

                                In November 2020 it was announced that the Weeknd would perform at the 2021 Super Bowl In Tampa, Florida.

                            <h2>Personal Life</h2>
                            <p>
                                Tesfaye prefers to keep his personal life out of the public eye.
                                In the beginning of his career, he refrained from participating in interviews and instead chose to communicate via Twitter, which he attributed to shyness and insecurities.
                                He prefers to be interviewed only in rare situations.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                rom April 2015 to August 2019, Tesfaye was in an on-again, off-again relationship with American model Bella Hadid.
                                She starred in the music video for his single "In the Night" in December 2015.
                                He dated American singer-actress Selena Gomez from January to October 2017.
                                Both of the relationships received widespread media attention, and were the topic of tabloid speculation.
                                Tesfaye has been in a relationship with Saudi-born disc jockey Simi Khadra since February 2022; publications have noted that unlike his previous romances, he has kept his with Khadra private from the press.

                                <br>
                                Tesfaye's hairstyle, which has been described as one of his most recognizable traits, has been claimed to be partly inspired by American artist Jean-Michel Basquiat.
                                He began growing it out in 2011 and remarked at how easy it was to maintain with "a hard shampoo every once in a while".
                                He cut his hair in 2016, prior to the release of Starboy.
                                On social media, Tesfaye typically suffixed his first name with "xo", which is often used as an emoticon for hugs and kisses.
                                According to The Guardian's Hermione Hoby, this was his intention, though others believe it was a reference to his recreational use of ecstasy and oxycodone.
                                He later altered the handles on his social media to reflect his stage name in preparation for the release of Starboy.

                                <br>
                                In January 2015, Tesfaye was arrested for allegedly punching a police officer in Las Vegas after being taken into an elevator to break up a fight.
                                He pleaded no contest and was sentenced to complete fifty hours of community service.

                                <br>
                                As of August 2021, Tesfaye was residing in Bel Air, Los Angeles. In 2017, he purchased a home in Hidden Hills, California for $18.5 million, which he sold to Madonna in 2021 for $19.3 million.
                                Tesfaye previously lived in penthouses in Westwood, Los Angeles and New York City.

                                In April 2023, Tesfaye revealed that he has attention deficit disorder.
